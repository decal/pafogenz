Note: path-list.txt must not have slashes appended to pathnames

HTML5 JavaScript is more likely to pass user input data through anchor text 
than any previous web platform version.  Although HTML5 offers the Web SQL
Database API as well as session storage for name/value pair bindings, it's
sometimes useful to utlize the URL anchor text to signify state transitions
in the rendered user interface, especially when taking advantage of the latest
approaches to programming structured declarations for framework code architecture 
in graphical user interface design. One relatively new example as far as web
application development is MVVM, sometimes used in ASP.NET's C# code-behind files
and elsewhere. The four capital letters represented with two characters is an 
acronym for "Model-View-ViewModel" which is a sibling of MVC 
(Model-View-Controller) API design of GUI (Graphical User Interface) code. 
This is why data/anchor.txt has been made optional.
